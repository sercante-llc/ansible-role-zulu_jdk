    # The Java-level namelookup cache policy for successful lookups:

    # any negative value: caching forever

    # zero: do not cache
    #
    # default value is forever (FOREVER). For security reasons, this
    # caching is made forever when a security manager is set. When a security
    # manager is not set, the default behavior in this implementation
    # is to cache for 30 seconds.
    #
    # NOTE: setting this to anything other than the default value can have
    #       serious security implications. Do not set it unless
    #       you are sure you are not exposed to DNS spoofing attack.

    # In some Microsoft Windows networking environments that employ

    # that fail may take a noticeably long time to return (approx. 5 seconds).
    # For this reason the default caching policy is to maintain these
    # results for 10 seconds.
